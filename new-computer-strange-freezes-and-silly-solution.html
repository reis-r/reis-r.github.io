It was my main and mostly only machine. I wished to buy a Thinkpad as an upgrade since I liked it so much, but with the whole COVID-19 crisis, the prices skyrocketed. I ended up buying an Acer Aspire 3 with AMD processor/video card, it was a more cost-effective choice than another Ideapad. I'm quite happy with it so far, and I'm enjoying being able to play some modern games.</p><p>But as soon as I got everything setup on the new machine, it started to freeze randomly. It would happen on random times, usually when I used a lot of RAM. It happened a lot of times when I was using Jupyter Kernels, and mostly when changing context from one application to another. The mouse wouldn't move, sound would glitch, all the system froze. I came to the point of reinstalling Windows 10 altogether two times, trying different driver versions and software to troubleshot the problem. I was praying for it not to be a factory defect since I could not afford not having a computer for work and study. The solution was quite surprising for me...</p><p>Two months of intensive testing and freezing and rebooting passed. I tried changing habits and not opening lots of programs and keeping them opened as I did previously. But what would be the point of having a newer, faster machine, then?</p><p>And then I searched for something I was sure it was NOT the problem, since I had used for my entire life and it has never failed me: Veracrypt. It turns out Veracrypt <strong>was</strong> just the cause of the problem. I had always used it's full disk encryption on Windows, but I used Windows 8 previously, and looks like with newer versions of Windows 10 it has a bug where the encryption keys end up in the paging file and deadlocking the system. You can find about it <a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/veracrypt/discussion/general/thread/f6e7f623d0/ >clicking on this thread</a>.</p><p>So the solution was disabling full system encryption, encrypting only sensitive files (and using Window's native system encryption). Of course, I could always go back to Linux, or dual booting, but I'm enjoying what became of Windows 10. I'll sure write about my experience on another posts.</p></div></section><nav id=menu><ul><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/pages/about-me.html>About Me</a></li></ul><ul><h4>Links:</h4><li><a href=/archives.html>Archives</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/reis-r>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/reis-r/ >LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://dobbs.town/@z>Mastodon</a></li><li><a href=https://undeadelectrichyena.bandcamp.com>My Music</a></li><li><a href=/feeds/all.atom>RSS</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/reis__r>Twitter</a></li></ul><ul><h4>By topic:</h4><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/clojure.html>clojure</a></li><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/linux.html>linux</a></li><li class=active><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/misc.html>misc</a></li><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/python.html>python</a></li></ul></nav><br><footer id=contentinfo class=body><address id=about class="vcard body"><center><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ rel=license><img alt="Creative Commons Licence" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ rel=license>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. <br> Proudly powered by <a href=http://getpelican.com/ >Pelican</a>, which takes great advantage of <a href=http://python.org>Python</a>. </center></address></footer></body></html>

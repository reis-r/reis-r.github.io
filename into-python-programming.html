I heard a lot about how the guy who created Python hates functional programming, and <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196">can't understand how a reduction works</a>. Even <a href=http://xahlee.info/python/python_3000.html>lambdas are broken</a> in Python. This is very dull, and basically why I kept myself far away from Python despite it's popularity. </p><h2>Surviving the snake bite</h2><p> In the Python Programming for Data Science module I had to learn... Well, Python. I gladly accepted the challenge. After years trying to figure <a href=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html>SICP</a> out, I found my zen regarding programming languages: "<i>If it has closures, I can do it</i>". We used <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25407018-data-science-from-scratch>Data Science From Scratch</a> as textbook and we had to implement the first chapter of the book (<a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/ch01.html>which is available for free</a>) as a nice warm-up to the language. After doing the exercises I implemented a <a href=https://telegram.me/delirious_woolf_bot>Markov Chain chat-bot for Telegram</a> in Python (source code for that can be found <a href=https://github.com/reis-r/markov-example>here</a>). I already had something like that running on JavaScript so it was more a matter of getting Python's syntax than the algorithm itself (which is pretty naive). </p><p> I'm by no means a Lisp Warlock, but I like the syntactic simplicity and general idea of this family of languages. As <a href=https://norvig.com/python-lisp.html>Norvig points out</a>, Python has indeed some "Lisp elements", and from the experience I had the main one is simplicity. Well, if you ignore baroque and ugly special forms (or should I say, syntactic sugar) like "list comprehensions" and the weird "for loop" nestings Joel Grus presents in his book. </p><h2>My humble antivenom</h2><p> The first thing I noticed is that function composition in Python is ugly. I do a lot of function composition on my code because generally collection functions (which uses dot notation) mutates data, so you have to use the "standalone version" of them, like in using <code>sorted()</code> instead of <code>list.sort()</code>. To solve the function composition problem I used a slightly modified version of <a href=https://mathieularose.com/function-composition-in-python/ >Mathieu Larose's <code>compose()</code></a>:</p><p><code>def compose(*functions: Callable) -> Callable:<br> ... ''Makes function composition more readable'''<br> ... return reduce(lambda g, f: lambda x: f(g(x)), functions, lambda x: x)</code></p><p> Notice that I changed the position of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> in the first (from left to right) lambda. That way you got to read from top to bottom, not bottom up. One other thing to notice is the type hints, type hints are our friends. With that, I was able to build long "pipelines" without affecting readability. One thing I noticed is that I started to use this pattern in function definitions, combining composition and application of some argument like <code>compose(...some_functions...)(some_argument)</code>. For sake of even more peace of mind when thinking about solving problems rather than carrying a couple variables around, I created a <code>piped()</code> function: the first argument is something that will applied to the composition of the functions that will be passed in the next arguments: </p><p><code>def piped(obj: Any, *functions: Callable) -> Any:<br> ... '''Applies some object into a function composition'''<br> ... return compose(*functions)(obj)</code></p><p>Now I can create cool functions from other functions like this one right here: <p><code> def next_word(words: Tuple[WordListNode], word: str) -> str:<br> ... '''Searches for the index of the next element of every occurrence of word'''<br> ... return piped(<br> ....... words,<br> ....... # get all occurrences<br> ....... partial(filter, lambda node: node_word(node) == word),<br> ....... # get all possible outcomes<br> ....... partial(map, next_node_index),<br> ....... # make it a tuple<br> ....... tuple,<br> ....... # choose the next state<br> ....... lambda e: choice(e) if e else -1,<br> ....... # get the chosen node<br> ....... partial(node_by_index, words),<br> ....... # get the word<br> ....... node_word<br> ... ) </code></p><p>I know this is not the "Pythonic" way to do stuff or whatever, I'm not a basic bitch. It works, it's quite readable and right to the point. I think maybe other people may find this interesting too. What I really hope is that I'll someday find some better solution for this.</p><h2>Why Python is cool</h2><p> Python is survivable. It's not bad at all. It's definitely easy to learn, maybe a good choice to work in teams. I wonder if that's why it got so popular in the Data Science realm. It also has a really huge community and, because of that, great libraries that manage to do a lot. I feel confident reading and developing Python code now, I definitely would accept working with Python. Nevertheless, I don't think I'll use it on any of my future toy projects as I have a little more joy using other languages (or just learning new ones for that matter). I may be giving Clojure a try soon, it looks quite interesting. </p></div></section><nav id=menu><ul><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/pages/about-me.html>About Me</a></li></ul><ul><h4>Links:</h4><li><a href=/archives.html>Archives</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/reis-r>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/reis-r/ >LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://undeadelectrichyena.bandcamp.com>My Music</a></li><li><a href=/feeds/all.rss.xml>RSS</a></li><li><a href=https://www.twitch.tv/boicolorido>Twitch.TV</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/reis__r>Twitter</a></li></ul><ul><h4>By topic:</h4><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/clojure.html>clojure</a></li><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/linux.html>linux</a></li><li><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/misc.html>misc</a></li><li class=active><a href=https://reis-r.github.io/category/python.html>python</a></li></ul></nav><br><footer id=contentinfo class=body><address id=about class="vcard body"><center><a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ rel=license><img alt="Creative Commons Licence" style=border-width:0 src=https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ rel=license>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. <br> Proudly powered by <a href=http://getpelican.com/ >Pelican</a>, which takes great advantage of <a href=http://python.org>Python</a>. </center></address></footer></body></html>

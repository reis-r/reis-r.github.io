      I have been using the &lt;a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com"&gt;DVORAK&lt;/a&gt; keyboard layout for years, and I'm really glad I did it, because it forced me to learn how to properly type.

      I have been using the &lt;a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com"&gt;DVORAK&lt;/a&gt; keyboard layout for years, and I'm really glad I did it, because it forced me to learn how to properly type. The problem comes when you want to input diacritics used in some languages (things like "ú" and "õ"). My usual setup was: using setxkbmap to turn on the DVORAK keyboard and using something like &lt;a href=""&gt;SCIM&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Input_Bus"&gt;iBus&lt;/a&gt; to activate the "latin-pre" input method to suit my special characters needs. This seems like overkill and I was searching for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href="https://xfce.org"&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt; does change between keyboard layouts and has DVORAK and a DVORAK international keyboard with dead keys, and with no special input method needed at all. I was curious about how this happens (probably some X11 "system-agnostic" configuration) and wanted to make whatever this is to work on &lt;a href="https://xmonad.org/download.html"&gt;xmonad&lt;/a&gt;. After a quick search at my ".config" folder I found a "keyboard-layout.xml" file with all the keyboard configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This is definitely what I was looking for. If you man setxkbmap, you see that there is a correspondence between the properties on the XML and the options for setxkbmap. So my setxkbmap command now looks like: &lt;code&gt;setxkbmap -layout dvorak,us -variant ,dvorak-intl -option grp:alt_space_toggle&lt;/code&gt; and I can simply switch between DVORAK and DVORAK international using &lt;kbd&gt;Alt + Space&lt;/kbd&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;

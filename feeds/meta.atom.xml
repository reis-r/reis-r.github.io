      &lt;p&gt;Hello, I have been busy. I created a Twitch channel so I could stream my games (mostly League of Legends, PUBG...). It's on portuguese but if you interact in english I may reply with no problem. If I get confident about it I may even do a talk show about computer and data science stuff instead of gaming. Anyway, the link to the stream is https://www.twitch.tv/boicolorido&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I'm currently getting a graduate degree in Business Intelligence and Data Science so I will probably have something to share from time to time. Also, my native language isn't English, so this could be a really good way to practice. I do some weird stuff with &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.dragonflybsd.org/"&gt;DragonFly BSD&lt;/a&gt;, and also some JavaScript programming so you might expect some content about that too.&lt;/p&gt;

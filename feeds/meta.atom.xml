      &lt;p&gt;After a lot of thinking, I decided to start writing a blog using my real name. As a paranoid kind of person, this feels a little strange. But I wanted a place to experiment and show what I'm up to lately, and maybe the information I put here will help other people to solve their own problems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm currently getting a graduate degree in Business Intelligence and Data Science so I will probably have something to share from time to time. Also, my native language isn't English, so this could be a really good way to practice. I do some weird stuff with &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.dragonflybsd.org/"&gt;DragonFly BSD&lt;/a&gt;, and also some JavaScript programming so you might expect some content about that too.&lt;/p&gt;

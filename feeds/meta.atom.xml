      &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to say Happy New Year to the internet before it's just too late to do so!ðŸ¤¡&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Actually, I've been pretty busy, with new job and moving to another town. But I'm fine and the sun is shinning brighter for me every day. I've been doing all sort of things but I have not really bigger project worth talking about. I completed some &lt;a href="https://cognitiveclass.ai/"&gt;IBM Cognitive Class&lt;/a&gt; courses (you can see my badges &lt;a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/10cf39d5-8a2f-45db-8f76-5b288e233a04/linked_in_profile"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm now focusing on the MOC "&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032"&gt;Data Wrangling with MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;" as "main goal". I still playing with lisp on my "free" off-line time, doing some basic CL exercises from Norvig's book &lt;a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp"&gt;Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming&lt;/a&gt;, but I just bought Mark Watson's &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/hy-lisp-python"&gt;new book on the Hy language&lt;/a&gt; and will go with it for now on, it looks really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So this is it, the year really started, as some say, "LIT"!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Hello, I have been busy. I created a Twitch channel so I could stream my games (mostly League of Legends, PUBG...). It's on portuguese but if you interact in english I may reply with no problem. If I get confident about it I may even do a talk show about computer and data science stuff instead of gaming. Anyway, the link to the stream is https://www.twitch.tv/boicolorido&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I'm currently getting a graduate degree in Business Intelligence and Data Science so I will probably have something to share from time to time. Also, my native language isn't English, so this could be a really good way to practice. I do some weird stuff with &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.dragonflybsd.org/"&gt;DragonFly BSD&lt;/a&gt;, and also some JavaScript programming so you might expect some content about that too.&lt;/p&gt;

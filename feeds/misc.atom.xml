      &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to say Happy New Year to the internet before it's just too late to do so!ðŸ¤¡&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Actually, I've been pretty busy, with new job and moving to another town. But I'm fine and the sun is shinning brighter for me every day. I've been doing all sort of things but I don't have a project worth talking about. I completed some &lt;a href="https://cognitiveclass.ai/"&gt;IBM Cognitive Class&lt;/a&gt; courses (you can see my badges &lt;a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/10cf39d5-8a2f-45db-8f76-5b288e233a04/linked_in_profile"&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I'm now focusing on the MOC "&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032"&gt;Data Wrangling with MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;" as "main goal". I still playing with lisp on my "free" off-line time, doing some basic CL exercises from Norvig's book &lt;a href="https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp"&gt;Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming&lt;/a&gt;, but I just bought Mark Watson's &lt;a href="https://leanpub.com/hy-lisp-python"&gt;new book on the Hy language&lt;/a&gt; and will go with it for now on, it looks really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;So this is it, the year really started, as some say, "LIT"!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Hello, I have been busy. I created a Twitch channel so I could stream my games (mostly League of Legends, PUBG...). It's on portuguese but if you interact in english I may reply with no problem. If I get confident about it I may even do a talk show about computer and data science stuff instead of gaming. Anyway, the link to the stream is https://www.twitch.tv/boicolorido&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I have been using the &lt;a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com"&gt;DVORAK&lt;/a&gt; keyboard layout for years, and I'm really glad I did it, because it forced me to learn how to properly type.

      I have been using the &lt;a href="https://www.dvorak-keyboard.com"&gt;DVORAK&lt;/a&gt; keyboard layout for years, and I'm really glad I did it, because it forced me to learn how to properly type. The problem comes when you want to input diacritics used in some languages (things like "Ãº" and "Ãµ"). My usual setup was: using setxkbmap to turn on the DVORAK keyboard and using something like &lt;a href=""&gt;SCIM&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Input_Bus"&gt;iBus&lt;/a&gt; to activate the "latin-pre" input method to suit my special characters needs. This seems like overkill and I was searching for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;a href="https://xfce.org"&gt;XFCE&lt;/a&gt; does change between keyboard layouts and has DVORAK and a DVORAK international keyboard with dead keys, and with no special input method needed at all. I was curious about how this happens (probably some X11 "system-agnostic" configuration) and wanted to make whatever this is to work on &lt;a href="https://xmonad.org/download.html"&gt;xmonad&lt;/a&gt;. After a quick search at my ".config" folder I found a "keyboard-layout.xml" file with all the keyboard configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt; This is definitely what I was looking for. If you man setxkbmap, you see that there is a correspondence between the properties on the XML and the options for setxkbmap. So my setxkbmap command now looks like: &lt;code&gt;setxkbmap -layout dvorak,us -variant ,dvorak-intl -option grp:alt_space_toggle&lt;/code&gt; and I can simply switch between DVORAK and DVORAK international using &lt;kbd&gt;Alt + Space&lt;/kbd&gt;!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I'm currently getting a graduate degree in Business Intelligence and Data Science so I will probably have something to share from time to time. Also, my native language isn't English, so this could be a really good way to practice. I do some weird stuff with &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;GNU Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.dragonflybsd.org/"&gt;DragonFly BSD&lt;/a&gt;, and also some JavaScript programming so you might expect some content about that too.&lt;/p&gt;
